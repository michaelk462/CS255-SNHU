## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client, DriverPass, plans to develop a website to help users prepare for their upcoming driving exams and final driving test. They aim to create a system that allows customers to access a range of content, from scheduling in-person training and lessons with instructors to utilizing self-study tools based on official DMV documents. The platform will handle all these features and offer different functionalities for employees and administrators to support customers effectively.
## What did you do particularly well?
I believe my charting was well-organized and effective, especially my activity diagrams. I ensured the requirements were distilled efficiently and paid attention to the organization and neatness of the design.
## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I especially want to reorganize parts of the UML Class diagram. I believe I included the correct information, but I aim to make the chart more organized and detailed.
## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Reading the interview transcript first was immensely helpful. I believe the class was structured to support our success if we engaged properly throughout. Converting the interview information into a Gantt chart and listing the required tasks in sequence provided a clear visualization of the external requirements for the website. Breaking down each section into basic tasks and assigning roles to each person involved (such as customer, employee, admin) helped me better understand the charts and how each task would be executed within the project or site. Considering the user's needs during design will also save time when assigning roles and building the website overall.
## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I still see myself as a beginner in software design. I recognize the importance of thoroughly reviewing and understanding all requirements before creating a checklist of essentials to ensure a successful development process. Breaking down these requirements into classes and objects to isolate their actions, then piecing them together to understand how they interact, is also crucial. Using diagrams to visualize these instances proves to be essential. Once the diagrams are complete, I can begin coding. This process has made me realize that I shouldn't jump straight into coding without first gaining a clearer visual and conceptual understanding of what I am developing.
